  <p>
  The Gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks are a type of reccurrent neural network
  with gated units similar to the LSTMs They are used in the full form and 
   several simplified variants. Their performance on 
   polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling was found
    to be similar to that of the LSTM
    They have fewer parameters than LSTM, as they lack an output gate. Otherwise
    they are identical.

    Since the GRU is so similar to the LSTM you can expect similar results as you
    would with that network.
